Biohazrd Conceptual Documentation
===================================================================================================

Biohazrd is a framework for creating native binding generators for C and C++ libraries. It aims to lower the amount of ongoing boilerplate maintenance required to use native libraries from .NET as well as allow direct interoperation with C++ libraries without a C translation later.
